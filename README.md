# wpf_hello
This repository is intented to host a WPF "hello world" application implemented in **c#** via Visual Studio. It is meant to work in Windows. Tested on Windows 11.

# Description
A simple WPF has been implemented, which displays in a window the text "Hello there!", this text is updated everytime the *Say Hello* button is pressed. In this way, the text is displayed in different colors chosen randomly.

The simplest way to see it in *action* is to run the **WpfHello.exe** located in ./bin/release/WpfHello.exe.
When the window pops-up, click on the *Say Hello* button to see the changes in color of the "Hello there!" text. Enjoy!
